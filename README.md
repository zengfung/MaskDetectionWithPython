# mask_detection

Goal: Analyze and understand the pros and cons of various machine learning techniques in classifying images into 2 groups - with masks and without masks

Algorithms that will be used:
* Support vector machines (SVM)
* Linear discriminant analysis (LDA)
* Logistic Regression
* via Singular value decomposition (SVD) properties
* Neural network
* Random forest
